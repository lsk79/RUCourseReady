# HackHERS: RUCourseReady: 
Authors: Lakshmi Kottapalli & Natasha Borda

 RU Course Ready is a dynamic website that allows you to rate Rutgers University classes, view peer feedback, and helps you generate a schedule to meet your goals and ensure you graduate on time. This website allows students at Rutgers University to view feedback about different courses as well as create an account and contribute with their own ratings and experiences. Additionally, the RU Schedule Generator has the ability to generates schedules that suits students' academic plans based on the classes they select and their set graduation date!

 Within 24 hours, we managed to build as much as possible but we plan on continuing to work on RU Course Ready in order to make it fully functional and allow students to experience the benefits of our idea! More specifically, we hope to incorporate generative AI for the RU Schedule Generator, as well as enhance some key features that can be more refined with time.
